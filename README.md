Introducing a Cutting-Edge Lane Tracking System with Dynamic Lane Change Detection

This innovative Python project empowers vehicles with the ability to navigate lanes and execute lane changes seamlessly using a robust combination of computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

Core Functionalities:

Accurate Lane Detection: Employs advanced image processing techniques (e.g., Canny edge detection, Hough transform) to precisely identify lane markings (solid, dashed) in real-time.
Robust Tracking: Leverages powerful algorithms to continuously monitor lane positions and curvature, ensuring reliable lane adherence even under varying road conditions and lighting scenarios.
Intelligent Lane Change Detection: Integrates machine learning models (potential approaches include: Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks) to effectively recognize driver intent for lane changes. This can be achieved by analyzing factors such as turn signal activation, steering wheel movement, and lane proximity.
Safe Maneuvering: The system prioritizes safety by incorporating decision-making logic that factors in surrounding vehicles and potential hazards before initiating lane changes. This might involve integrating with sensors like LiDAR or radar for a comprehensive understanding of the environment.
Key Advantages:

Enhanced Driver Assistance: Automates routine lane tracking tasks, reducing driver fatigue and improving overall driving experience.
Increased Safety: Proactive detection of lane changes and potential collisions, promoting safer roads for all.
Foundation for Autonomous Driving: Facilitates the development of autonomous vehicles by providing a crucial building block for lane navigation and maneuver planning.
Continuous Improvement:

This project is actively being refined to enhance its capabilities. Future enhancements include:

Incorporating Sensor Fusion: Integrating data from multiple sensors (cameras, LiDAR, radar) for a richer understanding of the driving environment.
Advanced Machine Learning Models: Exploring deeper neural network architectures to improve lane change detection accuracy and robustness.
Adaptability: Designing the system to adapt to diverse road environments (highways, city streets, country roads).
